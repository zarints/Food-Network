                    What can't cauliflower do? It's delicious as a puree, makes a great meaty steak and can star on its
                    own as an easy side dish.We subbed in cauliflower for all-purpose flour to make a soft and fluffy
                    gnocchi. Toss it in nutty brown butter-caper sauce for an indulgent gluten-free dinner.
